known
Rreq prop to M^(3/4) = Kleiber's law 

M^(3/4) = l^(9/4)
l = length

Rreq = oxygen required per unit time = dO/dt
M = mass of organism

Rabs prop to l^2 * nO2

problem
today's longest centiped = 0.3 m
carboniferous period 1.7 times oxygan as today
assume conc of oxygne limiting factor on size 
what is longest centipede in past


solution


Rabs = Rreq 

current:
l^2 * nO2 = l^9/4 * K
K = l^(-1/4) * nO2
l = 0.3

past:
l = (nO2/K)^4
l = (1.7/(0.3^(-1/4)))^4
