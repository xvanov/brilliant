#### Qs ####
1 consider system of 2 eqs, what are the possible number of sols and how to know which one it is? 27-58-1-33-29
2 DOF in context of matrices? 27-58-1-33-29
3 How to rref in python? 27-58-1-33-29
4 How to solve system of eqs in python? 27-58-1-33-29 
5 explain gaussian elimination? 27-58-1-33-29
6 what are the fundamental matrix operations?
7 what is ref?
8 what is rref? 
9 what is Kirchoff's law?
10 how to setup matrix to solve circuit with resistors and v source?

#### As ####
1 
- number of sols = 1, none, infinite
- row multiple of another -> infinite
- variable column multiple of another and sol column not zero -> none

2
- need as many eqs as dofs to have a chance to solve with exact solution (1 sol)
- DOF = # of vars

3
sympy.Matrix([[],...]).rref()

4
numpy.linalg.solve(numpy.array, numpy.array)

5
write eqs in matrix form
eliminate all vars in column except one starting from left to right

6 
reorder rows
multiply row by constant
add rows

7
row echelon form, all 0s below each pivot

8
reduced row echelon form, all 0s above and below each pivot

9

BAD QUESTION: step 2 can technically be done because eliminating 0 by adding 0 would count, the real problem is that zs are differnt.
