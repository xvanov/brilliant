#### Qs ####
1 consider system of 2 eqs, what are the possible number of sols and how to know which one it is? 26-57-1-33-29
2 DOF in context of matrices?
3 How to rref in python?
4 How to solve system of eqs in python? 
5 explain gaussian elimination?

#### As ####
1 
- number of sols = 1, none, infinite
- row multiple of another -> infinite
- variable column multiple of another and sol column not zero -> none

2
- need as many eqs as dofs to have a chance to solve with exact solution (1 sol)
- DOF = # of vars

3
sympy.Matrix([[],...]).rref()

4
numpy.linalg.solve(numpy.array, numpy.array)

5
write eqs in matrix form
eliminate all vars in column except one starting from left to right

BAD QUESTION: step 2 can technically be done because eliminating 0 by adding 0 would count, the real problem is that zs are differnt.
