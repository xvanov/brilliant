1 what are the 2 types of problems in multivariate calculus?
2 reimann sum of volume beneath z = f(x,y) > 0 on [a,b]x[c,d]
3 volume of tetrahedron with one vertex at the origin


as
1 
local problems and global problems
local = involving information near a fiven point
global = involving function and its domain
2
lim(deltax->0, deltay->0, sum(i=0,i=n,sum(j=0,j=m,deltax*deltay*f(xi,yj)))
3 
V = |a * (b x c)|/6
