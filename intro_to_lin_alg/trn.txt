#### As ####

m1 linear equations

m1q1 2 linear equatins in 2 unknowns
- number of sols = 1, none, infinite
- row multiple of another -> infinite
- variable column multiple of another and sol column not zero -> none

- need as many eqs as dofs to have a chance to solve with exact solution (1 sol)
- DOF = # of vars minus one for each linearly independent equation


m1q2 3 unknowns
none

4
numpy.linalg.solve(numpy.array, numpy.array)

5
write eqs in matrix form
eliminate all vars in column except one starting from left to right

6 
reorder rows
multiply row by constant
add rows

7
row echelon form, all 0s below each pivot

8
reduced row echelon form, all 0s above and below each pivot

9
sum of voltages around closed loop is zero

10 
write n equations for n unknows and put in matrix form

11
closed under addition = if u is sol and v is sol, then u+v is also sol
closed under scalar multipication = if u is sol, then so is cu

12
vector space 
- associativity for add and mul: (a+b) + c = a + (b + c), a(bv) = (ab)v
- commutatuivity for add: a+b = b+a
- distributivity: c(u+v) = cu+cv, (a+b)v = av + bv
- zero vector: v + 0 = v
- for all v E -v s.t. s + (-v) = 0
- closed under addition
- closed under scalar multiplication

13
a subsbace S of V is a vector space, whereby V contains all elements of S

14

4.5.1 [[cθ, -sθ],[sθ,cθ]]
4.5.2 n! where n = dimension of V.S.

m4q6
matrix that changes vector from one basis to another
deriving similar matrix:
B1 = basis 1 
B2 = basis 2
T(v) = w linear transformation with A1 in B1 and A2 in B2
P = transition matrix from B2 to B1

wB1 = A1vB1
wB2 = A2vB2
vB1 = PvB2
wB1 = PwB2

condition for A1 similar to A2:
A2 = P^-1 * A1 * P

BAD QUESTION: step 2 can technically be done because eliminating 0 by adding 0 would count, the real problem is that zs are differnt.
