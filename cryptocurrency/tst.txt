bri-cryptocurrencies
1/ describe latest version of the cryptocurrency system and all the problems it addresses
2/ what are the qualities needed in decentralized cash?
3/ what is a hash function?
4/ what is a cryptographic hash function?
5/ what is times8 and what is times7?
6/ how does splitting up number into blocks, hashing separtely and then concatenating affect the overall hash
   (assuming individaul hashings are eimple modular arithmetic)? 


1/
- current system
subsystem 1: dollar bill/cash
private:
s = secret key

public:
m = message , amount, from who, to who, transaction counter
g = big integer
n = big integer
p = (g^s)%n = public key
sig = (m*s)%n = signature

verification:
sig*


subsytem 2: creating and keeping track of the money and transactions
decentralized, 
everyone has copy of ledger where each new transaction is added to
everyone can verify new transaction



problems solved: 
- p formula (g*s)%n, also (g^s)%n: H cannot sign signature by just knowing public key
- decentralized: no signle point of failure, not manipulation by single entity possible
- g in formula: H cannot guess s by trial and error
- transaction counter: every message unique
- large n: multiple people cannot have the same p
- modular exponentiation: H has to solve discrete logarithm problem, to get g^(-1) (if H knows g^-1 they know s%n which is equivalent to knowning s), computing g^s%n is O(log2n) but inversing the operation is O(n).

current problems:


2/ 
- authentication
- tamper-resistance

3/
- function that takes any size as input and outputs fixed size
- deterministic

4/ 
- collision-resistant
- pre-image-resistant

5/ 
R = 2^(number of registers) if binary computer
times_f = x1*f+ x2*f^2 + ... xN*f^N mod R
