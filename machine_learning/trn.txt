q1 	what is the error/cost function of SVM/LogReg?
a1 	SVM: SUMi { max(0, 1-yi(w*xi-b)) - lambda*||w||^2 }
	LogReg: ln(1+e^(-w*x+b))
q2	Does SVM or LogReg have smaller error when a hyperplane perfectly divides 2 classes?
a2	SVM = 0 error
q3  how to find margin if we put some max error for log reg?
a3	ln(1+e^-Q) = Emax; Q = -ln(e^Emax -1); margin = 2Q/||w||
q4  SVM or LogReg for hares vs rabbits classifier?
a4	hares and rabbits are very similar -> log reg can handle overlap better so logreg is better

q1  how similar are two vectors x an y?
a1  depends on measure, ex: dot product, e^(-||x*y||^2)
q2  what is a kernel
a2  a function that defines the similarity between two vectors: k(x,y) = F(x)*F(y) = any inner product in a feature space
q3  what is a feature space?
a3  the space of all possible features, e.g. [h,w] for height and weight
q4  k1 ^ k2 is kernel ->? k3 = k1+k2 is kernel
a4  F1(x)*F1(y) + F2(x)*F2(y) = [F1(x), F2(x)] + [F1(y) + F2(y)] = F1nF2(x) + F1nF2(y) where n := concatenate = F3(x) + F3(y) -> k1+k2 is a kernel
q5  what are the properties of kernels?
a5  symmetry: k(x,y) = k(y,x); non-negativity: k(x,x) >= 0; cauchy-shwarz inequality: k(x,y) <= [k(x,x)*k(y,y)]^(1/2)
q6  how can i determine if a function is a kernel?
a6  split into nomials and each has to have both x and y
q7  what are the kernels: linear, radial, laplacian, polynomial
a7  linear = x*y; radial = e^(-||x-y||); laplacian = e^(-||x-y||^2/2*variance); polynomial = (x*y+r)^n
